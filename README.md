* The data structures were implemented using pointers to void, aiming for genericity.

* The folder Make contains the makefiles for Linux and Windows, which are called by the makefile in Estruturas.
* The folders related to the data structures follow this pattern:
> DataStructureName/DataStructureAttribute1/DataStructureAttribute2/...
>
    * **Example:**
> Queue/Dynamic -> Leads to the source code of the dynamic queue
* In addition, every data structure folder has a folder named Test, which contains a *test.c* file that checks if the data structure was implemented correctly.

* Makefile allows:
    1. To compile *test.c* ;
    2. To run the executable from ( i ) ;
    3. To clean all the files and folders generated by ( i ) and ( ii ).

### Compiling
* The makefile in Estruturas must receive an argument *F*, that is the data structure path.
    * **Example:** `make F=Queue/Dynamic`

### Running
* The makefile in Estruturas must receive *run* as an argument and the same *F* from ***Compiling***.
    * **Example:** `make run F=Queue/Dynamic`

### Cleaning
* The makefile in Estruturas must receive *clean* as an argument and the same *F* from ***Compiling***.
    * **Example:** `make clean F=Queue/Dynamic`

>#### ⚠️ Always write the data structure path like in the examples above.
